#Problem: Given an integer array "nums" and an integer "k", return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

#Constraints:
    # 1. Length of array nums is at least 1
    # 2. k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array]
    # 3. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique

#Test Cases
    # Example 1:
        # Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
        # Output: [1,2]
    # Example 2:
        # Input: nums = [1], k = 1
        # Output: [1]
